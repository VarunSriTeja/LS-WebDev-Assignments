            <h1>Game Overview</h1>
            <p>Chess is a strategic board game that has been played for centuries. It is a game of skill, strategy, and patience, and it is one of the most popular games in the world. The game is played on an 8x8 board with 64 squares and involves two players who control 16 pieces each.</p>
            <h1>History of Chess</h1>
            <p>The origins of chess are believed to date back to the 6th century in India, where it was known as "Chaturanga." The game spread to Persia, where it was called "Shatranj," and then to the Islamic world and eventually Europe. By the 15th century, the modern rules of chess began to take shape, and the game became the one we know today.</p>

        <h2>Basic Rules and Gameplay Mechanics</h2>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Objective:</strong> The primary objective of chess is to checkmate the opponent's king, which means putting the king in a position where it cannot escape capture.</li>
          <li><strong>Pieces:</strong> Each player starts with 16 pieces: one king, one queen, two rooks, two knights, two bishops, and eight pawns.</li>
          <li><strong>Board Setup:</strong> The board is set up so that each player has the white (or light) square in the bottom-right corner. The pieces are arranged in the following order: rooks in the corners, knights next to them, bishops next, then the queen on her color (white queen on white, black queen on black), and the king on the remaining square. Pawns are placed in the second row in front of the pieces.</li>
